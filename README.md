# bixi_analysis
Here you can find the analysis I did on BIXI riders' behaviour. My main focus was to compare the behavious or members and non-members. However, I also took a look at how the weather can impact BIXI rides. This is the final version of the project with the files that I created after multiple merges and transformations. Feel free to replicate this analysis. R-code is also available here. The only file that needs to be downloaded from an external source is the shape file from the city of Montreal. It is available here: http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/polygones-arrondissements
